GAVB Machine Learning Utility library

The library consists of a bunch of methods that can be used in order to help Data Scientists during the ML development reducing time spent and complexity of its codes.


## **Library Motivation and Description**

During the development of ML projects at GAVB, Data Scientists needs to coding some features for projects repeatedly. So, MLOps area identified the opportunity to create some standard functions that can be used many times by data science area in each different project.
Thus, it is possible to work with this framework that brings basically two main advantages: 
1 - Projects executed in less time than the usual, due to the code reusability;
2 - Establishment of a standard coding structure for GAVB projects.
